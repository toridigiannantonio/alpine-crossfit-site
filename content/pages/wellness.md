    <h2>Four recovery tools, one membership.</h2>
    <p>Alpine's wellness center brings together the recovery and performance tools usually scattered across separate clinics and studios — all on-site in Wheat Ridge, and included with your membership.</p>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li><strong>Steam sauna</strong> — a traditional steam sauna, not an infrared panel: enveloping, humid heat for circulation, recovery, and deep relaxation.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold plunges</strong> — ice-cold water immersion for recovery and cardiovascular stress adaptation.</li>
      <li><strong>Compression boots</strong> — sequential pneumatic compression that speeds lactate clearance and blood flow after hard training.</li>
      <li><strong>Peptide therapy</strong> — peptide-based recovery support for athletes focused on performance optimization.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-top:var(--space-8);padding:var(--space-6);border-left:3px solid var(--color-alpine-green);background:rgba(113,176,53,0.06);border-radius:var(--radius);">
      <p style="font-weight:700;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:0.1em;font-size:0.75rem;color:var(--color-alpine-green);margin-bottom:var(--space-3);">Peptide therapy notice</p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem;margin-bottom:var(--space-2);">Peptide therapy at Alpine is administered under qualified medical supervision. Every protocol is preceded by a screening consultation that reviews your health history, current medications, training goals, and eligibility.</p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem;margin-bottom:0;color:var(--color-text-muted);">Peptide therapy is not a substitute for medical advice or treatment of medical conditions. Consult your healthcare provider before starting any new therapy. Not all members are candidates — eligibility is determined during your consultation.</p>

    <h2>Can you use the wellness center without doing CrossFit?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The wellness center is included with <em>every</em> Alpine membership — and that starts with the <a href="/pricing/">{{ site.pricing.tiers[0].price }}/month Open Gym tier</a>, which covers facility access, the wellness center, and 24/7 entry. You never have to take a CrossFit class to use the sauna, cold plunges, or compression boots.</p>
    <p>That makes Alpine one of the few places in Wheat Ridge where sauna and cold plunge come bundled into a single flat monthly membership — no per-session booking, no per-visit fee.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">How it compares</span>
    <h2 class="section-heading">Alpine wellness vs standalone Denver studios.</h2>
    <p class="short-answer" style="max-width:70ch;">In the Denver metro, sauna, cold plunge, and compression are usually spread across three separate businesses at $149–$249/month each. Alpine bundles all three — plus peptide therapy and a full strength-and-conditioning gym — into one flat membership starting at {{ site.pricing.tiers[0].price }}/month.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Why members use it</span>
    <h2>Recovery that compounds.</h2>
    <p>Members use the wellness center to recover faster between training days, manage everyday stress, and simply feel better outside the gym. The sauna-and-cold-plunge contrast routine is a favorite — heat to loosen and circulate, cold to sharpen and reset — finished with a session in the compression boots.</p>
    <p>Whether you train hard six days a week or you just want a consistent recovery practice, the tools are here, and they're included.</p>
